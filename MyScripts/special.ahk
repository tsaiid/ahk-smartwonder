1. No evidence of bil. vesico-ureteral reflux during straining, voiding and post-voiding.
2. Normal contour of urinary bladder without filling defect noted.
3. No definite structure anomaly or fistula identified in this study.

::vur1::Reflux limited to ureter. Grade 1 vesicoureteric reflux is considered.
::vur2::Reflux up to the renal pelvis. Grade 2 vesicoureteric reflux is considered.
::vur3::Reflux with mild dilatation of ureter and pelvicalyceal system. Grade 3 vesicoureteric reflux is considered.
::vur4::Reflux with moderate dilated tortuous ureter and blunting of fornices but preserved papillary impressions. Grade 4 vesicoureteric reflux is considered.
::vur5::Reflux with severe dilated tortuous ureter, dilatation of pelvicalyceal system, and loss of fornices and papillary impressions. Grade 5 vesicoureteric reflux is considered.

Pharyngography
-Functional components of Swallowing
  -oropharyngeal phase
  -laryngeal dynamic
  -epiglottic tilt
  -cricopharyngeal opening
  -


Functional abnormality:

Leakage: Nil. Yes, due to: weak, atrophy or resection of tongue, poor dentures, paralysis of soft palate.

Nasal regurgitation: Nil.  Yes, due to: weakness of soft palate, or superior constrictor

Barium aspiration: Nil., Yes, due to : poor or absence of (epiglottic tilting, elevation of larynx, closure of larynx).

Retention: Nil.

-Swallowing stages analysis:
  -Control of junction of mouth and pharynx (stage 1): normal, (tongue deficiency, palatal deficiency with compensation; decompensation with leakage).
  -Closure of the palatopharyngeal isthmus (stage 2): normal, (deficiency of the pharyngeal palate with comensation, decompensation with nasopharyngeal regurgitation).
  -Compression of the bolus (stage 3): normal, (deficiency of the tongus, constrictor muscle, with barium retention in valleculae or piriform sinuses after swallowing).
  -Closure of the larynx (stage 4): . normal, laryngeal penetration.
       -Opening of the pharyngoesophageal segment (stage 5): : normal, overflow aspiration, retained bolus.

-Aspiration: Nil. Yes, during stage ///

-Structural anomaly: Nil. Yes, diverticulum (lateral pharyngeal pouch, diverticulum, laryngocele, Zenker's diverticulum, brachial cleft fistula, sinus, lymphoid hyperplasia,
