[T4] Tumor over the nasopharynx (more on left), left posterior nasal cavity and left parapharyngeal and left pterygopalatine fissure extension, involves bony structures of skull base (clivus, occipital condyle, more on left) with intracranial extension and involvement of left hypoglossal canal, left parasella cavernous sinus and left temporal base dura region.

[T4] Hx:13699837  A large tumor mass lesion involves nasopharynx(more on left side), left parapharyngeal space, left masticator space, left posterior nasal cavity, left upper oropharyngeal region, left retromaxillary space, left retropharyngeal space, bilateral  perivertebral spaces and left pterygopalatine fossa.
