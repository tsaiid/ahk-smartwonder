::ath::Atherosclerotic change with calcification of intracranial portion of vertebrobasilar arteries and bilateral internal carotid arteries.
::ath1::Presence of diffuse atherosclerotic change and with vessels wall calcification noted in the intracranial portion of the bil. internal carotid arteries noted.
::sae::Presence of .... bilateral periventricular low density noted, the subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy considered.
::sae2::Presence of mild/moderate/severe periventricular hyperintensity on T2WI and FLAIR noted, the subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy considered.
::ubo::Presence of several tiny hyperintensities in the periventricular white matter regions on T2WI and FLAIR, which may be gliosis, demyelination or tiny old ischemia or tiny previous brain insult.
::ubo2::Leukoaraiosis (some tiny/small hyperintensities on T2WI and FLAIR image in the periventricular and subcortical white matter regions) are mostly due to aging process and/or small vessel ischemic disease.
:c:imp::As the above descriptions.
:c:imp2::Others as above descriptions.
::ifch::from the imaging findings and clinical history, `
::mrmast::Increased signal intensity over -------------, mastoid air sinus on T2WI, in favor of mastoiditis or fluid collection in the mastoid.
::ctmast::Presecne of soft tissue density over ---- mastoid air sinus, R/O mastoiditis or fluid collection in the mastoid.
::ctatr::Diffuse atrophy of bilateral cerebral hemispheres, with compensatory dilatation of bilateral lateral ventricles, deepening and widening of cortical sulci.
::ctatr1::Mild dilatation of ventricular system and sulcal widening of bil. cerebral hemispheres noted, in favor of mild brain atrophy.
::mratr::Mild dilatation of intraventricular system with widening of subarachnoid space of bilateral cerebral hemispheres, in favor of aging process and mild brain atrophy.
::ctpbi::Presence of ---------tiny/small low density involved right/left/bilateral basal ganglion, right/left/bilateral thalamus, and right/left/bilateral periventricular white matter, previous brain ischemic insult, such as old tiny ischemic infarction considered.
::ctnsprt::Diffuse thickening and enhancement over the epiglottis, arytenoepiglottic folds, and posterior pharangeal wall over the oropharynx and hypopharynx, c/w post-radiation change.
