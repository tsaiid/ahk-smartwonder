::ath::Atherosclerotic change with calcification of intracranial portion of vertebrobasilar arteries and bilateral internal carotid arteries.
::ath1::Presence of diffuse atherosclerotic change and with vessels wall calcification noted in the intracranial portion of the bil. internal carotid arteries noted.
::sae::Presence of .... bilateral periventricular low density noted, the subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy considered.
::sae2::Presence of mild/moderate/severe periventricular hyperintensity on T2WI and FLAIR noted, the subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy considered.
::ubo::Presence of several tiny hyperintensities in the periventricular white matter regions on T2WI and FLAIR, which may be gliosis, demyelination or tiny old ischemia or tiny previous brain insult.
::ubo2::Leukoaraiosis (some tiny/small hyperintensities on T2WI and FLAIR image in the periventricular and subcortical white matter regions) are mostly due to aging process and/or small vessel ischemic disease.
