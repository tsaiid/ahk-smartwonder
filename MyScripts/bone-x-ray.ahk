Collapse of femoral heads is present, and joint spaces are mild irregular. The findings are consistent with avascular necrosis, stage IV.

Flattening or collapse of femoral head is present.
Joint space may be irregular.
CT scanning is more sensitive than radiography.
Subclassification depends on the extent of collapsed surface, as follows:
        Stage IVa: Less than 15% of surface is collapsed.
        Stage IVb: Approximately 15-30% of surface is collapsed.
        Stage IVc: More than 30% of surface is collapsed.
