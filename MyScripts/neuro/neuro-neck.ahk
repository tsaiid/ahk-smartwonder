INDICATION: %MyOrder%
TECHNIQUE:
Multi-slice CT scanner with
(1) Non-contrast and (2) Contrast-enhanced
scanning in axial plane from skull base to thoracic inlet with 5-mm-thick contiguous slices and coronal reformatted images.
Contrast medium: intravenous route, volume: 60 mL, rate: 1.0 mL/sec

COMPARISON:
Applicable previous CT of face and neck: none
Applicable previous MRI of face and neck: none

FINDINGS:

Due to no contrast-enhaned CT performed, the detail could not be evaluated. Film interpretation is limited.

No contrast medium. Film interpretation is limited.

The detail could not be evaluated in this noncontrast CT.

*Due to no contrast-enhanced CT performed, small enhancing lesion could not be evaluated.

*PS. The evaluation is limited especially for solid organs, lymph nodes, and vascular structure due to absence of contrast enhancement.

1. Primary tumor status:
[Tx] a. Unknown


2. Cervical nodes:

* right/left/bilateral level I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII

* right/left/bilateral
submandibular and submental space (level I)
carotid space (level II, III, IV)
posterior cervical space (level V)
anterior cervical space (level VI)
superior mediastinal space (level VII)

No evidence of bulky lymph nodes (> 1cm) over bilateral carotid space and posterior cervical space noted.

No evidence of bulky lymph nodes in shortest axis (> 1cm) over bilateral carotid space and posterior cervical space noted.

No evidence of bulky lymph nodes in shortest axis (> 1cm) over bilateral supraclavicular fossas noted.

No evidence of bulky lymph nodes in shortest axis (> 1.5cm) over bilateral submandibular and submental space noted.

b. Presence of several/multiple lymph nodes noted over -------- submandibular and submental space ,--------------- carotid space and --------------- posterior cervical space, the biggest size about --------  cm, R/O inflammatory or metastatic lymph nodes.

c. Presence of several lymph nodes noted over -------- submandibular and submental space , bilateral carotid space and posterior cervical space, the biggest size about 1.1 cm, R/O inflammatory lymph nodes. However, lymphoma, metastatic lymph nodes can not be completely excluded.  Suggest clinical check up.

d. Presence of several/multiple lymph nodes noted over -------- submandibular and submental space , ---------------carotid space and posterior cervical space, the biggest size about --------  cm, the differential diagnoses including lymphoma, metastasis, or inflammation, recommend biopsy or close follow up.

SUGGESTION:
Suggest clinical correlation and follow up.

PS. The evaluation is limited especially for solid organs, neck lymph nodes and vascular structure due to absence of contrast enhancement.
