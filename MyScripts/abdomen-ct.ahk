PROCEDURE: Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans.
TECHNIQUE description:
   Scanning range: Liver to symphysis, 5-mm contiguous scan.
   Contrast medium: Yes, 100 ml, 1-2 ml/sec, with 100 seconds scanning delay.

Clinical indications: colorectal tumor staging.

Previous similar study reviewed/comparison: Yes. (<date>) | NONE

Findings:

Rectal tumor
Size: [  x  x  cm]

T-stage of the tumor
[T1 (tumor invades the submucosa]]
[T2 (tumor invades the muscularis propria]]
[T3 (tumor invades the perirectal fat]]
[T4a: Tumor penetrates to the surface of the visceral peritoneum]
[T4b: Tumor directly invades or is adherent to other organs or structures ]

Lymph nodes: [No enlarged nodes / number and size of the lymph nodes in the perirectal space as well as along the major pelvic vessels]
N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
N1a: Metastasis in 1 regional lymph node
N1b: Metastasis in 2-3 regional lymph nodes
N1c: Tumor deposit(s) in the subserosa, mesentery, or non-peritonealized pericolic or perirectal tissues without regional nodal metastasis
N2a: Metastasis in 4 to 6 regional lymph nodes
N2b: Metastasis in 7 or more regional lymph nodes

M1a: Metastasis confined to one organ or site (e.g., liver, lung, ovary, non-regional node).
M1b: Metastases in more than one organ/site or the peritoneum.

NOTE: in case of mucinous-type of rectal tumor the involved lymph nodes may
have fluid-like density.

Bony metastases: [None] visible / number and size of any bony metastases
No abnormal findings in the liver, GB, biliary system, pancreas, spleen, and both kidneys.
Under lung window, no definite pulmonary nodules detected from available images
