(
Under sonography guidance, the gallbladder was localized. The skin was prepared and the area was draped. Under local anesthesia, a 6 Fr one-step pigtail catheter was placed transhepatically into the gallbladder. Dark green, mucinous fluid was aspirated. Then, the drain was fixed with Mefix/3-0 Nylon. The whole procedure was smooth, the patient tolerated well, and no immediate complication was noted.
