Noncontrast CT scan and post contrast CT scan of the orbit performed with axial and coronal section, 2-2mm slice thickness showed:

Previous CT of orbit: no

FINDINGS:

1. Presence of cystic/mass lesion, size about ---------- cm, over ----------.
2. ----------- of enlargement of -------------- rectus muscle and expophthalmos noted, ------- of tendon insertion, thyroid related ophthalmophathy/orbital pseudotumor more in favor.
3. No evidence of mass lesion over orbital, retro-ocular, sellar, suprasellar regions.

MRI of the orbit performed with Sagittal T1WI (localizer)
Axial T1WI and FSE T2WI with Fat sat
Coronal T1WI and FSE T2WI with Fat sat
Post contrast conventional T1WI with Fat sat showed:

Previous MRI of orbit: none

Findings:
No evidence of abnormal signal intensity mass lesion over the bil. orbital retrobulbar regions noted.

No obvious high signal intensity on T2WI over the bil. orbital retrobulbar optic nerves noted.

Post contrast study shows no obvious enhancement noted over the bil. orbital retrobulbar optic nerves noted.

No evidence of abnormal hyperintense lesion noted over the white matter and corpus callosum on T2WI and FLAIR noted, no MRI evidence of multiple sclerosis plaques.

No definite abnormal signal intensity mass lesion in the brain noted including supratentorial cerebral hemisphere and infratentorial cerebellum and brain stem region.

The bilateral lateral ventricles showed symmetrical without dilatation.

Post contrast study showed no abnormal enhancing lesion in the brain and no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement noted.



1. Presence of soft tissue mass, size about----------cm, noted over--------
2. No evidence of bulky lymph nodes over ---------------- carotid space and ----------------- posterior triangle of submandibular and neck regions was noted.
3. Presence of several/ multiple lymph nodes noted over --------------- carotid space and ---------------- posterior triangle of submandibular and neck regions, the biggest size about-------cm.
4. Presence of lymphadenopathy over ------------- carotid space and ------------ posterior triangle of submandibular and neck regions was noted.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of abnormal signal intensity mass lesion over the bil. orbital retrobulbar regions noted.
No obvious high signal intensity on T2WI over the bil. orbital retrobulbar optic nerves noted.
Post contrast study shows no obvious enhancement noted over the bil. orbital retrobulbar optic nerves noted.
